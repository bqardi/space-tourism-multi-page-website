## Overview

Users should be able to:

- ✔️ View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

In this project I have really focused on accessibility; mouse, touch, keyboard, screenreaders, etc.

I thought it would be fun to make the Explore button (anchor tag) take you to random locations.
Each render of the Home page would yield a new random endpoint.
